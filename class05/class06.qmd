## R Functions

Functions are how we get stuff done. We call functions to do everything useful in R.

One cool thing about R is that it makes writing your own functions comparatively easy.

All functions in R have at least 3 things:

-  a name (we get to pick this)
- one or more input arguments (the input to our function)
- the body (lines of code that do the work)
