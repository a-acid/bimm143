```{r}
pbd_file <- "pdbstats.csv"
pdb <- read.csv(pbd_file)
```
```{r}

```

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

My pdb stats data frame has numbers with commas in them. This may cause us problems. Let's see:
```{r}
pdb$X.ray
```
```{r}
x <- as.numeric("20000")
```

```{r}
as.numeric(pdb$X.ray)
```

We found a function called `gsub()` now we can figure out how it works
```{r}
as.numeric(gsub(",","",pdb$X.ray))
```

I can turn this snippet into a function that I can use for every column in this table 

```{r}
commasum <- function(x){
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",x)))
}

commasum(pdb$X.ray)
```

Apply across all columns 
```{r}
totals <- apply(pdb,2,commasum)
totals
```

```{r}
totals/totals["Total"]*100
```
>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

86.7

>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

```{r}
(215684/2497751891*100)

```

# 2. Visualizing Protein Structure

We will learn the basics of Mol * (mol-star)homepage: 
https://molstar.org/viewer/

We will play with PDB code 1HSG

![](1HSG.png)

Show the ASP 25 amino acids:

## Back to R and working with PDB structures

Predict the dynamics (flexibility)  of an important protein


```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```
```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```
```{r}
pdbseq(hiv)
```

Here we will do a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) to predict fucntional motions of a kinase protein.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
modes <- nma(adk)
plot(modes)
```

Make a "movie" called a trajectory of the predicted motions:
```{r}
mktrj(modes, file="adk_m7.pdb")

```

Then I can open this file in Mol*
