Here we analyze a candy dataset from the 538 website. This is a CSV file from their GitHib repository.

## Data Import

```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.csv"

candy <-  read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

```{r}
candy
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

85

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

30

>Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Root Beer Barrels", ]$winpercent
```

>Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```
>Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```


```{r}
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```

```{r}
x <- c(5,3,4,1)
#sort(x)
```

```{r}
order(x)
```
>Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

Win Percent

>Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

whether or not the candy has chocolate / is chocolate or not 

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
candy[inds,]
```

>Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

>Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

no

>Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

below

>Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)])
mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)])
```

Higher

>Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
choc.win <- (candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)])
fruit.win <- (candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)])
```

```{r}
t.test(choc.win,fruit.win)
```

Yes. 

>Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```

>Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent, decreasing = TRUE),], n=5)
```

##Overall Candy Rankings

>Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

>Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col()+
  labs(y= NULL,x="Win Percent")
 
  ggsave('barplot1.png', width=7, height=10)
```

![](file name)
Add some color to our ggplot. We need to make a custom color vector.

```{r}
## start with all black vector of colors

my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "#9cc599"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "#fcbacb"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "#feba4f"
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols)+
  labs(y= NULL,x="Win Percent")

ggsave('barplot2.png', width=7, height=10)
```
>Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Nik L Nip

>Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst

```{r}
candy$pricepercent
```

If we want ot see what us a good candy to buy in terms if winpercent and pricepercent we can plot these two variables and then see the best candy for the least amount of money

```{r}
ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent,pricepercent, label=(rownames(candy)))+
  geom_point(col=my_cols)+
  geom_text()
```
To avoud the overplotting of all these laebls we can use an add on package called ggrepel

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent,pricepercent, label=(rownames(candy)))+
  geom_point(col=my_cols)+
  geom_text_repel()
```


play with the `max.overlaps` parameter to `geom_text_repel()`

```{r}
ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent,pricepercent, label=(rownames(candy)))+
  geom_point(col=my_cols)+
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 7)
```
>Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reese's Miniatures

>Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

##5 Exploring the correlation structure 

```{r}
library(corrplot)
```
```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```
>Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Fruity and chocolate 

>Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

chocolate and bar


#On to PCA

The main fucntion for this is called `prcom()` and here kniw we need to scale our data with the `scale=TRUE` argument

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")

```

```{r}
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

p
```

```{r}
p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```
##loadings plot

```{r}
loadings <- as.data.frame(pca$rotation)

ggplot(loadings)+
  aes(PC1,reorder(rownames(loadings), PC1))+
  geom_col()
```
>Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruity, Pluribus, Hard
